To find:
  The sum of all even fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000

Method 1:
  Brute force - O(2**n) or O(n) algorithm

Method 2:
  Again, an O(n) algorithm. The difference is that this uses a formula.


  My find:
    The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of 2 odd and 1 even numbers, as in - E,O,O,E,O,O... (starting from zero)
    f(n) V n>6, can be written as 4*f(n-3) + f(n-6)
      
      f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
      f(n) = 2*f(n-2) + f(n-3)
      f(n) = 3*f(n-3) + f(n-4) + f(n-4)
      f(n) = 3*f(n-3) + f(n-4) + f(n-5) + f(n-6)
      f(n) = 4*f(n-3) + f(n-6)

    The significance of this sequence is that it is a set of 3 subsequences of fibonacci sequence which contain every third term.
    One such subsequence is the sequence of all even fibonacci numbers.
    Therefore one does not need to check if x%2==0, thus making this method of solving 3x faster.
