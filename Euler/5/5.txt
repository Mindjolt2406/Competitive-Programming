To find:
  Smallest number which is divisble by n(20 actually)

Approach : Find LCM of all numbers from 1 to 20


Method I - Brute Force

  Start iterating from n and keep adding n while checking if the iterator is divisble by all numbers from n/2 to n.

  Time Complexity: O(n^n) (Loose upper bound)
  Space Complexity: O(1)

Method II - A better algo - Find the LCM
  
  To find LCM(a1,a2,..,an), find LCM(an,LCM(an-1,...LCM(a2,a1)))
  Since all the LCMs are pairs, we can use the formula a*b = LCM(a,b)*GCD(a,b)
  It is easy to compute GCD.

  Time Complexity: O(nlogn)-> Takes(log(n,2) to compute gcd(n,n/2).Worst case, do it n times)
  Space Complexity: O(1)
