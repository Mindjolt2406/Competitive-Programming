if you were pissed because of me, I would try to resolve it asap.
You know very well that I don't like you guys playing here for the sole reason that I can't do whatever I want to do. 
My room is my personal space, you guys just can't invade that.
You make me look like an unreasonable bastard in front of other people.
If I wanted, you know very well, I could have persuaded you guys to go to their room, or acted extremely unreasonable and could've told you guys to get out.
I don't like confrontations in front of other people. If we argue, that better not come out in from of the whole world.
Doesn't it ever strike to you that I am not comfortable.
Seriously, I have never engaged in an activity where you had to leave, apart from those english sessions, which happened once.
