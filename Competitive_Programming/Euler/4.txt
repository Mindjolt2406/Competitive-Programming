To find:
  The largest palindrome number on multpiplying 2 3-digit numbers

Method 1:
  Use brute force to mulitply every 3 digit number with each other and check if is a palindrome.Then find the max for it.

Method 2:
  It is similar to the first approach. The only difference is that instead of multiplying 990*990 numbers, I'll be multiplying 99*990 numbers instead.
  Palindromes are divisible by 11. 
  This can be easily checked by the divisibility by 11 rule. 
  The rule says that the sum of the digits in the odd places - sum of the digits in the even places %11==0 => n%11==0
  Palindromes always fall under this category as the length of a palindrome is always even. 
  Thus I'll multiply 990*(999,998...1) then 981 and so on.
  This algo is 10x faster than Method 1
