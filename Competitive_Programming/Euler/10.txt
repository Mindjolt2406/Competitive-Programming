A simple prime sieve
To find:
    The sum of all the prime numbers less than 2000000

Approach : The Sieve of Erasthothenes

Method I
    Generate an array of size 2000002 and intialise all the elements to True except for l[0] and l[1] -> False( We know they aren't prime)
    Iterate through the array. If an element is true, make all it's multiples false. 
    The remaining indices of all the remaining True elements are prime numbers

NOTE
    For larger n,say 10**12, we can't make an array of that size. 
    So, one can use a segmented sieve, where an array of size (say) 10**6 is created. 
    Now, after 'sieving' the first 10**6 elements, run through the other segments of 10**6 and continue. 
    Just remove the multiples from of the primes from the previous sieve first.
    The time compexity remains the same - O(nlog(log(n))), but space complexity reduces to 10**6 + k, where k is the number of primes till n.
