Hello, World!

Welcome to the CAMP - IMT2019 group! 

We've created this group to put up puzzles, hold discussions, announce contests and basically anything to get you into the world of competitive programming. The long term motive is to give you guys a shot at qualifying for the ICPC regionals.

We recommend you to make accounts on the following websites. These websites are from where we are going to suggest problems/contests for you to practice from.

www.codeforces.com
www.codechef.com
www.atcoder.jp
www.spoj.com

AtCoder Beginner contests (ABC) and Codeforces Div 3 contests are the best contests to start off from. They are short 2 hour contests which happen weekly.

(There's one Codeforces round coming up tomorrow!)

Codeforces Div 2 and Codechef LunchTime are slightly harder. Do give them a try!

Codechef is famous for its 10 day monthly long challenges. There's one which starts in the first week of April

Stay tuned for further updates and happy problem solving!
